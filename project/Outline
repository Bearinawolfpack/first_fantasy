1. User stories.  What can a user do in your app?  How will they do it?


As a user, I want to be able to pick my class to prepare for battle. (Create)

As a user, I want to see my classes abilities. (Read)
As a user, I want to select my ability. (Read)


As a user, I want to add an ability after I level up. (Update)
As a user, I want to be able to respec (change class). (Update)

As a user, I want to be able to delete my account. (Destroy)



2. Clear delineation as to what is MVP (minimum viable product) for your app versus stretch goals (things your app doesn't need, but would be nice to have)
